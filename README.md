# NFT Guild - NFT verification tool

Welcome to the open-source repository of the Cardano NFT Guild for project NFT verification.  This site will contain documentation, information about agreed standards, and of course the latest code for the verification tool as we build it. Our goal is to supply the Cardano Community with standards and tools for verifying NFTs.

While we set things up, be sure to join the guild discussion in our Discord server at https://discord.gg/ffbyt6eWWB

We also have a Catalyst Fund7 proposal asking the Cardano Community to support our project. Full description can be found at https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/NFT-Verification-Tool-Open-Source/382368-48088. Please be sure to give it a read and we appreciate your support in the upcoming vote.
